Great that the domain is working! Now let's set up your Jekyll blog using Docker on your Ubuntu VM. This will let you develop and preview your blog locally before pushing changes to GitHub.



Here's what to do next:

1. Create your blog directory structure:
```bash
# On your Ubuntu VM
mkdir -p ~/cloudcommand-blog
cd ~/cloudcommand-blog

# Clone your existing GitHub repo
git clone https://github.com/aollivierre/aollivierre.github.io.git .
```

2. Copy all the files from the artifact above into your directory structure:
```bash
# Create directories
mkdir -p _posts _layouts _includes _sass assets

# Create the files (copy content from artifact)
# Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, Gemfile, _config.yml, .gitignore
```

3. Build and start the Jekyll container:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

4. Your blog will be available at:
- Local development: http://your-vm-ip:4000
- Production: https://cloudcommand.org

5. Create your first blog post:
```bash
# Create a new post in _posts directory
touch _posts/2024-01-18-welcome-to-cloud-command.md
# Add the content from the example post in the artifact
```

6. Commit and push your changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Set up Jekyll blog"
git push origin main
```

Would you like me to:
1. Explain how to create and customize blog posts?
2. Show how to add different types of content (images, code blocks, etc.)?
3. Help with setting up a different theme?
4. Add specific blog features you're interested in?
