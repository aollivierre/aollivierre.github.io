Welcome to Cloud Command! This blog is dedicated to sharing knowledge about cloud computing, DevOps practices, and automation techniques. In this post, I'll demonstrate how to use various formatting features available in our blog.

## Adding Images

You can add images to your posts using standard Markdown syntax. Here's an example:

![Cloud Computing Diagram](/assets/images/cloud-diagram.png)

Images should be placed in the `/assets/images/` directory. They will automatically be styled with a subtle shadow and rounded corners.

## Code Blocks

Our blog supports syntax highlighting for various programming languages. Here are some examples:

### Python Example

```python
def hello_cloud():
    print("Welcome to Cloud Command!")
    
    # Dictionary of cloud services
    cloud_services = {
        'AWS': 'Amazon Web Services',
        'Azure': 'Microsoft Azure',
        'GCP': 'Google Cloud Platform'
    }
    
    for service, name in cloud_services.items():
        print(f"Learn about {name} ({service})")

hello_cloud()
```:

### YAML Example

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./site:/usr/share/nginx/html
```:
